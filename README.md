## Features

- **Kanban Boards** - Organize tasks across workflow columns (Backlog → Progress → Review → Testing → Done)
- **Project Dashboard** - All projects overview with search and filtering
- **Task Management** - Drag-and-drop tasks with time tracking and comments
- **Team Collaboration** - Developer-specific task assignments and workflows
- **Dual Architecture** - Choose between server-based or local file-based operation
- **AI-Friendly Format** - Tasks are stored as Markdown files, making it easy to generate task descriptions with AI tools and seamlessly import them into Fira

## Quick Start

Choose your deployment mode:

### Local Mode (Personal Use)

Perfect for offline project management with direct file system access.
```bash

unzip fira.zip
cd fira/web

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Start server

## AI-Powered Task Generation

Fira's Markdown-based format enables seamless integration with AI tools for task creation:

1. **Generate tasks with AI** - Use any AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate task descriptions in Markdown format with YAML frontmatter
2. **Save to project directory** - Place the generated `.md` files directly into your project's workflow folders (`backlog/`, `progress/`, etc.)
3. **Instant visibility** - Tasks appear immediately in Fira's Kanban board without any import process

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Generate task with AI and save to backlog
echo "---
title: Implement user authentication
estimate: 8h
priority: high
status: backlog
---

# Task Description
Implement JWT-based authentication..." > projects/my-project/backlog/AUTH-001.md
```

The file-based architecture means any tool that can write Markdown files can create tasks for Fira.
